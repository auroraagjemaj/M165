**Difference between Replication and Sharding:**

Replication involves copying data across multiple servers to increase availability and ensure fault tolerance. If one server fails, another can take over and provide the data, ensuring continuous operation.

Sharding, on the other hand, splits the database into smaller parts (shards) and stores them on different servers. This enhances scalability by distributing the load across multiple servers, which is especially important for handling large amounts of data.

**Recommendation for Your Company's MongoDB Application:**

The company should check if replication is already providing sufficient availability. If performance is being impacted by the increasing data volume, I recommend implementing sharding. This will effectively distribute the data load and make the application's performance scalable.
